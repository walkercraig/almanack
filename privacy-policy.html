    <p>
      Challenge Media, LLC. ("<strong>Challenge Media</strong>") operates almanack.blog
      and may operate other websites. It is Challenge Media's policy to respect your
      privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
    </p>

    <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
    <p>
      Like most website operators, Challenge Media collects non-personally-identifying
      information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available,
      such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and
      time of each visitor request. Challenge Media's purpose in collecting
      non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
      Challenge Media's visitors use its website. From time to time, Challenge Media may
      release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
      publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Challenge Media also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
      Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged-in users and for users leaving
      comments on almanack.blog blogs/sites. Challenge Media only discloses logged-in
      user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and
      discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that
      commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the
      administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
    </p>

    <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>
      Certain visitors to Challenge Media's websites choose to interact with
      Challenge Media in ways that require Challenge Media to gather
      personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
      Challenge Media gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we
      ask visitors who sign up at
      <a href="http://almanack.blog">almanack.blog</a> to provide a username and email
      address. Those who engage in transactions with Challenge Media are asked to
      provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial
      information required to process those transactions. In each case, Challenge Media
      collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill
      the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Challenge Media. Challenge Media
      does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
      below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
      information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
      website-related activities.
    </p>

    <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
    <p>
      Challenge Media may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
      websites. Challenge Media may display this information publicly or provide it to
      others. However, Challenge Media does not disclose personally-identifying
      information other than as described below.
    </p>

    <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>
      Challenge Media discloses potentially personally-identifying and
      personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors,
      and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
      process it on Challenge Media's behalf or to provide services available at
      Challenge Media's websites, and (ii) have agreed not to disclose it to others.
      Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located
      outside of your home country; by using Challenge Media's websites, you consent to
      the transfer of such information to them. Challenge Media will not rent or sell
      potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
      anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations as
      described above, Challenge Media discloses potentially personally-identifying and
      personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order,
      or other governmental request, or when Challenge Media believes in good faith
      that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
      Challenge Media, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered
      user of a Challenge Media website and have supplied your email address,
      Challenge Media may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new
      features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on
      with Challenge Media and our products. If you send us a request (for example via
      email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it
      in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support
      other users. Challenge Media takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect
      against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially
      personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
    </p>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's
      computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the
      visitor returns. Challenge Media uses cookies to help Challenge Media identify
      and track visitors, their usage of the Challenge Media website, and their website
      access preferences. Challenge Media visitors who do not wish to have cookies
      placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before
      using Challenge Media's websites, with the drawback that certain features of
      Challenge Media's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
    </p>

    <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
    <p>
      If Challenge Media, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the
      unlikely event that Challenge Media goes out of business or enters bankruptcy,
      user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a
      third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer
      of Challenge Media may continue to use your personal information as set forth in
      this policy.
    </p>

    <h3>Ads</h3>
    <p>
      Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising
      partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize
      your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
      information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad
      networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they
      believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
      cookies by Challenge Media and does not cover the use of cookies by any
      advertisers.
    </p>

    <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
    <p>
      Although most changes are likely to be minor, Challenge Media may change its
      Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Challenge Media's sole discretion.
      Challenge Media encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any
      changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have an almanack.blog account, you might
      also receive an alert informing you of these changes. Your continued use of this
      site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of
      such change.
